# standUpPi
Pet project for Raspberry Pi 2, to recognise people and work with online Agile board on standups.
Build using Python 2.7 and few external libraries. Project is very basic, and is more of a compilation of few examples of different technologies.

Face recognition is handled via Microsoft API of [Project Oxford](https://www.projectoxford.ai/), set of API to enable you with Face/Image/Voice/Language recognition

List of **hardware used** for this project:

1. Raspberry Pi 2 
2. Raspberry Pi Camera. You may find very handy library to work with [Pi Camera over here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/python/README.md) and some tutorials as well 
3. Ultrasonic rangefinder HC-SR04. And [here](http://www.modmypi.com/blog/hc-sr04-ultrasonic-range-sensor-on-the-raspberry-pi) is a neat article on rangefinding with this sensor and Raspberry Pi.
4. 1k resistor and 2k resistor (for voltage devider)
5. bunch of jumper wires
